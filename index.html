</div>
<div id="Explanation">
Computing has made many contributions to society, but one of the most important is the effect on social connectivity. Thanks to computing (specifically the internet and 
social media like <a href="https://www.snapchat.com">snapchat</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>), people are more connected than ever. This increased connectivity 
has many benefits, a few of these being:
<ul>
<li>Ability to communicate with a wider range of people</li>
<li>Decreased cost of long range communication</li>
<li>Increase in the strength of social connections</li>
</ul>
